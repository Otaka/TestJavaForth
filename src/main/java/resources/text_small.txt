0 Hamlet
Although Hamlet himself desires to see Claudius pay for his crime,
he realizes the evil in the deed of killing the king, prompted by both
"heaven and hell" (II.ii.586). The ghost has placed Hamlet in a most
unnatural position by asking him to commit murder.
5 Hamlet hates the king for his treachery, but he would not act on that
hate if he were not prompted to do so by the ghost.
